I have my [personal blog](https://createsmartapp.com) where I write about software development as well as research projects, artificial intelligence, ML, technical business, business development, methodologies and other random stuff that comes to my mind. I did it that way to honor my scientific and tech background. The code shared is open sourced and can be found (later) in [this repo](https://github.com/biroattila/sciwork_code).

In addition, some of the posts have code for supporting the articles. The code is available in [this repo](https://github.com/miguelgfierro/sciwork_support).
